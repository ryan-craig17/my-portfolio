# Ryan Craig | Full Stack Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio site, built with React and TypeScript. It showcases my development skills across front-end, back-end, and everything in betweenâ€”including dynamic routing, custom components, responsive design, and modular architecture.

---

## Technologies Used

- React + TypeScript
- React Router (v6)
- SCSS Modules
- Custom hooks and reusable components
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Customization

Feel free to tailor the project to your style and needs:

- **App Metadata**  
  Update `public/manifest.json` and `index.html` to define your site name, theme color, favicon, and description.

- **Global Styles**  
  Modify SCSS variables in `/styles` or `global.scss` for custom colors, typography, and responsive breakpoints.

- **Routing Structure**  
  Edit `AppRoutes.tsx` to manage your navigation tabs and route configuration.

- **Page Content**  
  Add or update views in the `pages/` folder to expand your portfolio, like a Space Station showcase, blog, or contact form.

- **Components**  
  Create reusable UI pieces in `components/` or domain-specific logic in `features/`.
